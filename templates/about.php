        <p>My name is Anthea Middleton, which is a bit of a weird name, and people often don’t believe me. When I was in 6th year in school someone told me it was like a hobbit name though, and that made me happy.</p>
        <p>I currently work as a software developer in Scotland, in spooky re-purposed art deco high school.</p>
        <p>I make electronic things for fun, and if I ever finish any of them and stop adding new features I’ll write about it here. I also enjoy aerial acrobatic dance and read lots of sci-fi and detective novels. I’m trying to write my own novel at the moment. It’s like this blog but fictional and set partly in space.</p>
        <p>That’s me there. With a Paddington.</p>
